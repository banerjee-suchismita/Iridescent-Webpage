            It is possible to trace the steps of a person's life by delving into documents and diaries. We can read the birth certificates. We can memorize the accomplishments and quote the passages. These artifacts are useful, but they do not tell us about a person's soul or about what really mattered to them during a lifetime. These words on paper are like nails that construct a framework for a life, but they do not fill the structure. They do not put the “life” into the lifetime.

            Many people will say that they cannot identify what draws them to a person, whether the attraction is professional, political, or personal. They can only say that some unnamed property of speech or dress pulls them there. I believe that I have identified the quality that engages me. I know what my spirit looks for in another person.

            It is iridescence.</p></a>

        <p id="hello">The dictionary defines iridescence very simply: displaying a play of lustrous colors, like those of the rainbow. There is greater texture and meaning to the word. It sings through otherwise monotonous tasks. It paints with a vivid palette across the context of time. It knows, instinctively, when a phrase can motivate others.</p>
        
        <p id="hellopt2">Iridescent people,they don’t just play music; they are music. They don’t just tell a joke; they are joy. They don’t just plant a seed; they create an environment for growth. Some embraced the flavor and spice of luxurious textures when they were young, but when they grew older they preferred a life less challenging. Because iridescence demands something in return from those who linger in its embrace: that you search out the fire in others. It requires you to help others develop and grow into the multi-dimensional beings that they are.It asks you to inspire. Some people can put on a veneer of iridescence, but it is not the same. You can tell the difference between a person who wears brilliant colors, and yet shines from within, and one who does not. It is like a blue snow cone—artificial and unnatural. But if you see real glaciers, you can see that ice is not colorless. It can be the color of a baby’s blanket or the tones of teal or aquamarine.

        Iridescence can be demonstrated in a voice, in movement, in a laugh. Iridescent people pull the best from others. They sparkle, but they also reflect, and it is that reflection that shows the real essence of a life. Like a prism filling a room full of rainbows, iridescence fills the frame of a lifetime.</p>
